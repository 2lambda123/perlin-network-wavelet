**wavelet** is an open ledger for scalable, mission-critical, decentralized WebAssembly applications.

Wavelet's very first protocol specification was written by Kenta Iwasaki and Heyang Zhou. This repository serves as Wavelet's initial [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation written by [the Perlin team](https://perlin.net).

Refer to the docs located [here](https://wavelet.perlin.net) to learn how to locally setup your own three-node cluster, learn how to write/deploy a WebAssembly smart contract, or learn how Wavelet actually works.

## We're hiring!

Here at [Perlin](https://perlin.net), we spend days and weeks debating, tinkering, and researching what is out there in academia to bring to industries truly resilient, open-source, secure, economic, and decentralized software to empower companies, startups, and users.
                                                        
Our doors are open to academics that have a knack for distributed systems, engineers that want to explore unknown waters, frontend developers that want to make and evangelize the next generation of customer-facing applications, and graphics designers that yearn to instrument together greater user experiences for decentralized applications.

## Contributions

First of all, _thank you so much_ for taking part in our efforts for creating the ultimate decentralized ledger.

All code contributions to _wavelet_ should comply with all idiomatic Go standards listed [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

All commit messages should be in the format:

```bash
module_name_1, module_name_2: description of the changes you made to the two
    modules here as a sentence
```

Be sure to use only imperative, present tense within your commit messages and optionally include motivation for your changes _two lines breaks_ away from your commit message.

This allows other maintainers and contributors to know which modules you are modifying/creating within the code/docs repository.

Lastly, if you'd like to talk to us or any of the team in real-time, be sure to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dMYfDPM)!

We are heavily active, ready to answer any questions/assist you with any code/doc contributions at almost any time.
